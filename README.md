## Welcome!

This Fiddler plug-in will simulate your title's behavior due to lack of connectivity to various Xbox Live services. For example, you can test your title's behavior if Rich Presence is returning 429s, or if all services are returning 503s. You should use this tool to help ensure your title's functionality degrades gracefully due to connectivity failures.
